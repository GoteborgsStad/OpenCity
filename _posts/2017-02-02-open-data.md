# Open data from the City of Gothenburg

The city have been publishing open data since 2009 and has recently strengthened it commitment thru a renewed effort 
with a better organisation with an established process and checklists as well as a platform for publishing open data and 
syndicating it to the national portal [oppnadata.se](http://oppnadata.se/). We will be sharing as much as we can 
concerning this effort.

## Checklists

The checklists for creating open data was created during the fall of 2016 and early 2017. They will help the city in making sure that the open data that is published meets the established criteria.

## The open data

All open data published by the city of Gothenburg can be found at [goteborg.se/psidata (swedish only)](http://www25.goteborg.se/psidata).
