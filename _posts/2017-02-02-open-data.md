# Open data from the City of Gothenburg

The city have been publishing open data since 2009 and has recently strengthened it commitment thru a renewed effort 
with a better organisation with an established process and checklists as well as a platform for publishing open data and 
syndicating it to the national portal [oppnadata.se](http://oppnadata.se/). We will be sharing as much as we can 
concerning this effort.

All open data published by the city of Gothenburg can be found at [goteborg.se/psidata (swedish only)](http://www25.goteborg.se/psidata).
